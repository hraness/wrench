# Knowledge base

This Git-backed Markdown vault is durable memory for Wrench. Open `kb/` itself as the vault. Markdown and Git are authoritative. Catalogs, backlinks, graph views, semantic indexes, repository context, and Git projections are derived.

Start repository work with the pinned KB command exposed by this repository, then expand through bounded links, exact metadata, text search, or history only when needed.

## Record boundaries

- `articles/` holds self-contained captured sources and local assets.
- `notes/` holds maintained concepts and synthesis.
- `plans/` holds proposed through terminal coordination records.
- `riffs/` holds cleaned first-person notes made from dictated or stream-of-consciousness source material.
- `scopes/` holds curated repository-context hubs.

The [[scopes/repository--cdb4ee2aea69|repository context hub]] explains repository-wide rule boundaries. [[notes/documentation-ownership|Documentation ownership]] records the durable split between guides, docs, executable contracts, and KB context. [[notes/repository-seams|Repository seams]] records which interfaces may cross repository boundaries.

Git history is the maintenance log. Do not add generated backlink sections or a second append-only fact store. Each record owns its metadata, links, and typed outbound relationships.

## Maintenance

Run `bun run kb:refresh`, review the bounded findings in context, and finish with `bun run kb:check`. Parallel note lanes use `bun run kb:check:lane`; render the complete disposable inventory with `bun run kb:catalog`.
